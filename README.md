# Project Title

This is a basic chat application demo using Angular, Node and Socket IO.

## Getting Started

The project is comprised of a multi tier architecture with the api directory containing the server side code and the chat directory containing the front end code.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Angular CLI
Node JS
```

### Installing

Both api and chat directories are part of a multi tier architecture and contain independent servers for running the application.

In the api directory run:

```
yarn install
```

Then to start the backend server run:

```
yarn start
```

In the chat directory run

```
yarn install
```

Then to start the front end server run:

```
ng server
```

## Code Challenge Project Notes

1. I changed up the project structure since Iâ€™m using Angular CLI to avoid building out Webpack configurations for a scratch project.

2. SCSS is not located in a single file but is separated into files across the project per Angular best practices.

  A. Styles.scss - src/styles.scss: contains global styles, currently resets and minor styles for maintaining percent based dimensions.

  B. All other styles are bound to the related components that comprise the application.

3. Component architecture consists of the use of one module with three components:

  A. Chat Component - serves as a smart/container component.

  B. Chat Form Component - serves as a dumb/child component.

  C. Chat Bubble Component - serves as a dumb/child component.
